# AI_FinalProject


A machine learning model has been trained to perform autonomous parking using optimization algorithms in a simulation environment created with Unity,
adhering to physical laws and closely resembling reality. The vehicle model, equipped with distance sensors and cameras, is capable of finding a parking spot,
performing parking maneuvers, and monitoring oncoming vehicles. Unity ML Agents extension is used for model training. The most optimal reward system was 
established through trial and error, preventing the AI from resorting to undesirable shortcuts solely to obtain the reward in each round. The training logic
used in this project can be applied to real vehicles using the same configurations and sensors.

In this project, deep reinforcement learning (Deep Reinforcement Learning), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and imitation learning methods were used, and 
the created model has been deployed (is ready for use).
